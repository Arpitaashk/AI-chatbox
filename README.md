**DESCRIPTION
This project implements a basic rule-based chatbot using Python. Designed to simulate human-like conversation, the chatbot uses simple pattern matching to understand user input and respond with predefined replies. The chatbot is structured around intents, each defined by a set of keywords and corresponding responses.

Key features include:

Recognition of common conversational phrases like greetings, farewells, thanks, questions about identity, age, and humor.

A lightweight keyword-matching mechanism to detect user intent.

A randomized response system to give varied replies for each intent.

A debug mode to help visualize token matching and intent detection during development.

The chatbot runs in the terminal and serves as an excellent foundational project for understanding how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversational logic can be implemented in Python without external machine learning models.**
